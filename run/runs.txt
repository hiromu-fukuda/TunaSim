Perhaps look at 2 contrasting levels of
variability in each of effort_devs and length-at-age, and maybe also
recruitment to see how the estimates depend on these things. Some small
proportion of outliers should also be thrown in to see how the robustness
works. You may also want to keeps separate results for analyses where M is
estimated independently and where M is assumed at its correct value.
