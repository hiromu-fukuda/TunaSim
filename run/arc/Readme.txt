1r prefix baseline runs (effort devs=.1) moderate
2r prefix higher effort devs(=.4) mod-diff?
3r prefix lower effort devs(=.01) easy-mod??
4r prefix lower overall effort (.5*baseline) difficult?
5r prefix higher overall effort (2*baseline) easy?
6r steady decline in recruitment moderate
7r variable high recruitment moderate-easier
8r same as baseline but with lower sd/length at age NOW CASE 10
9r Low sample size (100), high variability in catch and effort (cv=40%) NOW CASE 9
10r Rho  cv of 5% (to get cumulative effect of growth variability            NOW CASE 11
11r ?? same as 9r? NOW CASE 8
12r Trend in q's
13r Increasing stock size trajectory, constant R, F
 
.m same as above but with M estimated...
1c baseline with catchability turned on
